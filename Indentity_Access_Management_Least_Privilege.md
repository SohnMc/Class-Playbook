# Least Privilege

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. Users are assigned roles, and roles are assigned permissions. This ensures that users can only access the information and resources necessary for their job functions.

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a type of access control system where the owner of the protected system, data, or resource sets the policies defining who can access it. DAC is flexible and allows users to share information at their discretion, but it can also be less secure since it relies on the owner's decisions.

## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a type of access control that tightly regulates how data and resources are accessed based on the classification of information and the userâ€™s security clearance. In MAC, the operating system enforces the policy that defines which users or system processes can access certain resources, making it highly secure but less flexible.

## Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model based on the principle of maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone by default, even those already inside the network perimeter. It requires verification at every stage of digital interaction and assumes that threats could exist both inside and outside the network. The Zero Trust model emphasizes continuous verification, limiting access to only what is necessary, and maintaining a robust monitoring system.
