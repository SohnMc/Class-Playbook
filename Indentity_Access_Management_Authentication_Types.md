# Authentication Types

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction. It combines two or more independent credentials: what the user knows (password), what the user has (security token), and what the user is (biometric verification).

## Biometrics
Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify that they are who they say they are. Examples include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and iris scanning. Biometrics are considered highly secure as they are difficult to replicate or steal.

## Password Policies
Password policies are rules designed to enhance security by encouraging users to create reliable, secure passwords and store them properly. Common password policy requirements include a minimum length, a mix of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular updates. Additionally, policies might include restrictions on password reuse and guidelines for securely storing passwords.
