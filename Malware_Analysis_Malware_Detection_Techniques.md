# Malware Detection Techniques

## 1. Signature-Based Detection
This method relies on a database of known malware signatures. Antivirus software scans files and programs for these signatures to identify and block malware.

### Tools:
- Norton Antivirus
- McAfee
- Kaspersky

## 2. Heuristic-Based Detection
Heuristic-based detection analyzes the behavior of programs to detect potential malware. It can identify new, previously unknown malware by examining code structures and commands.

### Tools:
- Avast
- Bitdefender
- Sophos

## 3. Behavioral Analysis
Behavioral analysis monitors the behavior of programs in real-time. It identifies malware based on suspicious activities such as unauthorized file modifications or network connections.

### Tools:
- Cylance
- CrowdStrike
- SentinelOne

## 4. Sandbox Analysis
Sandboxing involves running suspicious programs in an isolated environment to observe their behavior. This helps in identifying malware without risking the actual system.

### Tools:
- Cuckoo Sandbox
- FireEye
- Sandboxie

## 5. Machine Learning-Based Detection
Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns associated with malware. These algorithms can detect new and evolving threats more effectively than traditional methods.

### Tools:
- IBM QRadar
- Darktrace
- Vectra AI
