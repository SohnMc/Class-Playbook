# Types of Malware

## 1. Viruses
Viruses are malicious programs that attach themselves to legitimate files and programs, replicating and spreading when the host file or program is executed. They can corrupt, delete data, or even render systems inoperable.

### Characteristics:
- Requires user action to spread
- Can alter or delete files
- Often spreads through email attachments or downloads

## 2. Worms
Worms are standalone malicious programs that replicate themselves to spread to other computers. Unlike viruses, they do not need to attach themselves to an existing program. Worms often exploit network vulnerabilities to spread.

### Characteristics:
- Self-replicating
- Does not require user action to spread
- Can consume bandwidth and overload network servers

## 3. Trojans
Trojans are malicious programs disguised as legitimate software. They trick users into executing them, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to the user's system.

### Characteristics:
- Disguised as legitimate software
- Does not replicate
- Can create backdoors for unauthorized access
